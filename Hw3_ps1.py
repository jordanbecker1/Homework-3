# Here are the variables:
P = float(input("Please input initial principal balance: "))
r = float(input("Please input interest rate: "))
n = int(input("How many times is the interest applied per time period ? "))
t = int(input("How many times has the period elapsed ? "))

def main():

	# This is the solution:
	A = int(P * ((1 + (r / n) ** (n *t)))
		# Testing by printing A
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
